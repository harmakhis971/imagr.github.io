{"name":"Imagr.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"# Imagr\r\n\r\nImagr is an application designed to be run from a NetInstall environment created with [AutoNBI](https://bitbucket.org/bruienne/autonbi/src). It is able to restore a disk image and install packages on a target volume. It is not intended to be a replacement for tools such as DeployStudio, but is able to perform some of their more commonly used functions to allow organisations to run more complicated workflows than just basic NetRestore without the need for OS X in the datacentre.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Imagr, check out [Imagr](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/imagr) on github.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
